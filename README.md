# Somebotty

a simple Twitch bot with scriptable commands that probably isn't useful for anyone except for me

## Writing commands

Commands are written in [BobaScript](https://github.com/sand-head/BobaScript) and are contained in the `commands` directory. That directory is tracked for changes, so any additions, deletions, or modifications are hot-reloaded.
